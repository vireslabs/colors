# 🎨 ColorsNFT

**ColorsNFT** is a unique NFT collection where each token is a square of a single color.  
You choose the color (e.g. `#ff0000`), and that color becomes:

- the **name** of your NFT,
- and its **image**.

## ✨ Features

- Mint a unique NFT by choosing any color in the `#RRGGBB` format.
- All artwork and metadata are stored fully **on-chain**.
- Mint price: **0.001 ETH** on the **Sepolia testnet**.
- Colors are unique — the same color cannot be minted twice.

2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, Trust Wallet, etc.).
3. Pick a color using the color picker or enter a code like `#RRGGBB`.
